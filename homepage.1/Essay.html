        <p>     Jackson Heights is chaotic. It’s crowded with immigrants from all over the world. It’s like a 
        compacted box, stuffed with people equally annoyed by how crowded it is. Sidewalks are filled with 
        spokespeople, luring people into their stores to save 30% off their latest items. Everyone is exhausted, 
        navigating through the intense traffic and we are infuriated when someone abruptly stops in the middle of
        the street. Corners of streets are flooded with trash bags, thrown against trees. </p>
        <p>     Within all this havoc, there happens to be even more inside a restaurant located on the corner of 
        73rd street 37th RD: <a href="http://kababking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kabab King. </a> 
        They are notorious for their long wait and the jam-packed lines that spill out onto the streets. It’s sweaty and parents 
        yell into my ear as they navigate through the packed store to
        find their lost child. The workers run around, shouting orders to one another. Even then, the people sigh 
        and complain about how it’s been over 30 minutes and they have yet to receive their two pieces of naan and
        chicken kabab. Then, there are the privileged: those who have a seat in the back of the store, isolated
        from the rest of us. Only four tables with a whopping ten chairs, reserved by brown people sipping their
        chai. They smirk at us with maliciousness in their eyes while we suffer in silence. Yet, with all this
        commotion, we continue to go. </p>

        <p>     As a kid, after a long day of shopping through India Sari Palace, New Debosree Fashion, and Payless, my legs were drained and I wanted to go home. Luckily, my mother took my family and me to Kabab King to ease our leg pains every time. The store smelled like me: paprika, cumin, turmeric with a mix of sweat from the humidity of the store. While we waited for our order, we admired the mishtis, pulao, and samosas heating up behind the glass; the aroma of spicy ginger paste, sweet cardamoms seeping through the cracks of the glass, and the citric taste of coriander in the air made us crave food even more.
        </p>
        <p>     Different languages like Punjabi, Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Tamil, and Nepali filled the air alongside the sound of searing meat in the background. They presented their culture, through language as well as clothing, and diffused with other cultures. Hindus witness Muslims saying their prayers before eating while Muslims see Hindus limit specific orders from the menu.
        </p>
        <p>     As an outsider, seeing these Hindus and Muslims enclosed in the same environment peacefully may appear abnormal but this is standard behavior here. They don’t just serve food, they serve as a connection and unite us despite our differences. Muslims have religious tensions with the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. In America, this hostility carries on but when we eat at the store serving our traditional foods, we forget the differences for a second. As I run to the seats once our food arrives, trying to claim the seats of privilege, we sit beside those of different ethnicities but we are connected with our love for kababs.
        </p>
        <p>
                Through this obsession for the commodity, we share our lives: exchanging our favorite orders of biryani and our stories. As we gobble down our food, my father reaches out to the people sitting next to us, asking about their journey to America and their favorite shops. Food isn’t just for eating, it’s for sharing and hearing the tales of others. Food bridges the gap between us and makes us realize that regardless of how we look, we all value the delicate balance of spice and pungency in our kababs.
        </p>
        <p>
                Despite the once impeccable reputation, the store now carries a 3.6 rating on Google Maps with the food and menu no longer being what it once was, but we go for a reason: we see ourselves within the madness. After all, like the store, we struggle to manage the plate we have at hand, to find ourselves amidst the crowd and in white America. Yet, the employees work within the panic and raise smiles through the scent of simmering curry. The families laugh, feeling relief after finding their lost child, and sit with others broadcasting the almost horror story. Through this chaos, we have connected: finding peace within the mayhem of life.

                As New Yorkers, life is hectic but a community can ease one's pain. Places like Kabab King continue to strive with their community. Sometimes seeing others who look like oneself builds solace. Sometimes seeing a community of those from different ethnic backgrounds can also invoke these emotions. Sometimes when we struggle, we end up in Kabab King, tasting the spices of our culture and seeing the workers as well as the customers struggle. Sometimes kababs are the only answer we have in a world full of chaos.
