      </div>
      <div class="history">
        <p> Prior to what we know nowadays as Jackson Height, the community infused in culture from all the world, 
        it was nonexistent during the 1900s. Before this time, Jackson Height was known as Trains Meadow section
        of Newtown (now Elmhurst) and consisted of farms. In 1901, the construction of the Queensboro Bridge, spanning
        from Manhattan to Long Island City, resulted in the development of streets, sewer systems and sidewalks from 70th
        to 92nd street. "Jackson" comes from John Jackson, the president of Hunters Point and Flushing Turnpike Company
        while "Heights" was used to make the community more appealing. Slowly, apartments grew throughout the community, beginning
        with rent ranging from $24 to $45. In 1917, a train station was built in Jackson Heights and as president
        of Queensboro Corporation, MacDougall sought to increase revenue by building apartments inspired by the "Garden
        City" movement. This movement was in reaction to the unsanitary life at tenements thus the new apartments
        in Jackson Heights were popular. However, as they continued to build these apartments, Anglo-Saxon Protestants moved 
        in. By the 40s and 50s, Jewish and Latinx people arrived to New York, eventually Asian immigrants
        arrived with the removal of the 1965 Immigrant Act. </p>
