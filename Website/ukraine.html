      <h1> The Ukranian War & How It Shows White Supremacy</h1>
      <h2>Context of Ukranian War</h2>
      <p>Since the USRR separated, new countries formed of the areas in the east of the USRR. Countries such as Bulargia, Ukraine and
      Poland formed and eventually many of these countries, excluding Bulgaria and Ukraine, joined NATO. NATO was an alliance made in the
      West with the Cold War and to prevent the spread of communism. The USRR then created their own alliance, the Warsaw Pact, as a 
      response to NATO. Eventually, Ukranians called to join NATO but Putin fearing Russia losing influence of Ukraine, decided to 
      invade the south of Ukraine claiming it was no longer a part of Ukraine. The government refused to join NATO, rather growing 
      closer to Russia causing many rotests, leading to a lot of violence. Soon Zelensky became president and Putin increased troops
      within the border of Ukraine and invaded the country. President Zelensky was unique because he was a known actor/comedian from <i> Servant of the
      People</i>, a show representing a Ukranian teacher who became president. The show captured many Ukranian as well as Russian
      people despite their poltical differences Moreover, once Biden was elected, Zelensky recognized that Biden would support Ukraine even with the tension with Russia. 
      Eventually, in February (hours before Russia attacked Ukraine), Zelensky spread throughout social media through video showing his authority despite Russiaâ€™s attempt 
      to remove him during the war. He wanted to take Ukraine on a path without Russia. 
      This and the fact that Zelensky is not afraid of Putin, willing to put himself at risk for Ukraine, makes him a threat to Russia.</p>

    <h2> Why Do I Feel Like The Treatment of the War is Problematic?</h2> 
    <p>Though discussing wars and conflicts throughout the world is extremely important, I have a problem with how everyone was so quick 
    to support Ukraine and talk on the subject but when it comes to problems in countries dominated by people of color, they are often not
    spoken about. Ukranian people are white and remain in Europe thus they would have never expected such conflicts to arise, it is 
    seen as unexpected. Just like this idea, America was so quick to provide refuge to Ukranians while forgeting that those in South
    America also may face conflicts within their country. Moreover, Ukranians were quickly given citizenship while it takes Latino
    people almost 8 years just to get a green card. This displays that based on race, treatment of citizenship is very different as well as
    the discussion of the issues on media. Moreover, there has been plenty of proof showing that Uyghur Muslims are placed in intermet
    camps, Palestinian land is being inavded by Israeli people, Afghanistan being overthrown, etc however, America has done nothing to 
    help them. Yet they choose to help Ukraine. </p>

    <p>
    Personally, it feels as though America tends to play hero by only aiding thosee who they
    deem fit to aid while also hardly helping those they say they support. For example, America has held an oil sanction because Biden 
    believes that receiving oil from Russia will result in a higher oil price and also help stop the war. Though America is sacrificing 
    the importation of Russia, the effects this action will have is minuscule. Russia can sell their oil to China and India, where then 
    America will buy from these countries. Additionally, European countries have not stopped buying oil from Russia thus not much effect 
    will occur if it is only America. However, Americans will suffer as oil prices rise drastically because oil is a global price, so if 
    there are shortages in Asia it goes up for everyone. Biden plans to lower the price of oil by releasing oil from the barrels that the 
    US keeps reserves for emergency purposes. With America holding sanction, companies such as McDonalds, Pepsi and Starbucks would stop 
    their business in Russia to stop the war. 
    <b> I do not believe that these issues should be compared and I don't mean to diminish what is happening in Ukraine,
    but this is what I have observed. </b>
